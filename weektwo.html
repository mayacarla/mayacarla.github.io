  For my sketch, I wanted to comment on one of Auriea Harvey's earlier works with Net Art. I found her introduction to computers inspiring; it was reassuring to read Harvey's experience with computers mirrors my journey with them. My favorite of Harvey's earlier works was <i>skinonskinonskin</i>. The HTML page highlights Harvey's vulnerability, which she conveys with a limited color palette and very few elements on display for the spectator.

  In the interview, <i>Auriea Harvey and the Future of Digital Sculpture</i>, Harvey expands on the way in which she has successfully integrated her sculptures into the web. Sculpture is Harvey's current focus; she renders her pieces by taking 3D scans to place on the web. Although she is unaware of where her advancements in 3D sculpture may lead, she possesses an optimistic outlook for digital artwork and the timeless archive the web provides artists.
