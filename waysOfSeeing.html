  I was captivated by John Berger's observation of our perception of material being a mechanism in how we connect with the visual world. To respond to his assertion, I chose to use p5 to distort a screenshot from his program, Ways of Seeing. The p5 sketch fills the original image (seen on the left) with buttons to change the spectator's perspective of Berger's appearance.

<br>
  I decided to use buttons because Berger's comments on perception equating value to what we see remind me of the film Coraline. In the film, Coraline has access to two realities through a tunnel in her home. To distinguish the two worlds, which mirror one another, Coraline notices in one people have buttons for eyes. Her experience in an alternate reality ultimately leads her to express gratitude for her real life.
