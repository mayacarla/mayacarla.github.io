<p id="col">
  The medium, or process, of our time—electric technology—is reshaping and restructuring patterns of
social interdependence and every aspect of our
personal life. It is forcing us to reconsider and reevaluate practically every thought, every action,
and every institution formerly taken for granted.
Everything is changing—you, your family, your
neighborhood, your education, your job, your government, your relation to "the others." And they're
changing dramatically.<br>
<br>

The family circle has widened. The
worldpool of information fathered by
electric media—movies, Telstar, flightfar surpasses any possible influence
mom and dad can now bring to bear.
Character no longer is shaped by only
two earnest, fumbling experts. Now all
the world's a sage.<br> </p>

<br>

  <p id= "dif"> The shock of recognition! In an electric information environment, minority groups can no longer be contained—ignored. Too many people know too much about each other. Our new environment compels commitment and participation. We have become irrevocably involved with, and responsible for, each other.
  </p>

  <br>
<br>

<p id= "col1"> Electric circuitry has overthrown the
regime of "time" and "space" and pours
upon us instantly and continuously the
concerns of all other men. It has reconstituted dialogue on a global scale.
Its message is Total Change, ending
psychic, social, economic, and political
parochialism. The old civic, state, and
national groupings have become unworkable. Nothing can be further from
the spirit of the new technology than
"a place for everything and everything
in its place." You can't go home again. <br>
<br>

Societies have always been shaped more by the
nature of the media by which men communicate
than by the content of the communication. The
alphabet, for instance, is a technology that is absorbed by the very young child in a completely
unconscious manner, by osmosis so to speak.
Words and the meaning of words predispose the
child to think and act automatically in certain ways.
The alphabet and print technology fostered and
encouraged a fragmenting process, a process of
specialism and of detachment. Electric technology
fosters and encourages unification and involvement. It is impossible to understand social and
cultural changes without a knowledge of the workings of media.
