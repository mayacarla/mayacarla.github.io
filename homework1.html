    The editorials, “As We May Think” and “Long Live the Web” had an overwhelming sense of trust and hopefulness about the future of the web. However, the author's predictions are contingent that users utilizing their machines to maximize workflow. Dr. Vannevar bush urges individuals of science to “turn to the massive task” of making machines that can store our “bewildering stone of knowledge” (Bush).
    By upgrading the mediums (photography, film, written records, etc.) people use to record their findings in their respective disciplines, people may expedite access to their information. In doing so, people may “sharp[en] their focus and with that, some incredible discoveries will come to light.” Throughout Bush's article, he carries an uplighting tone of the relationship people will have with their machines and the methods they choose to communicate their findings. He writes with a sense of eagerness to eliminate his concern that records will “become lost in the mass of the inconsequential” without an organized methodology for technology. To diminish this looming concern, he proposes that those in a specialized practice organize their records by association–similar to how the brain makes connections. Once implemented, Bush theorizes that it will “push him [the user] to the conclusion of his work rather than [having him] bogged down partway by overtaxing his limited memory.”

   Tim Lee concurs with many of the sentiments vocalized by Bush. Lee,  writing in the zeitgeist of 21st-century technology, expresses his disdain for surveillance internet activity. He praises the universality and diversity of an open-sourced web culture. Lee views links as a gateway to digital democracy as anyone may have access to communicate freely and may add to sites. An open-sourced web will, in turn, eliminate his fear of limited innovation and a heightened homogony of internet discourse that will present itself in the presence of monopolies. Although the author resists data monitorization, he concurs that open data creates transparency amongst government and health organizations. His main concern, assumed by his subsequent remarks, is to rely on web applications as they are accessible and can be designed by internet users. By participating in the architecture of the web, we can shape this as an innovative tool for future users that “will create things we cannot ourselves imagine” (Lee).
